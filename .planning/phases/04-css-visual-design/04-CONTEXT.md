**Gathered:** 2026-02-03
**Status:** Ready for planning

Organized CSS architecture with proper theming, WCAG contrast compliance, and responsive design. Includes CSS modules migration, dark/light theme system, responsive typography, and visual polish. Performance optimization and accessibility testing are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Theme System
- Initial theme behavior, storage method, toggle placement, and transition style all at Claude's discretion
- Should follow standard best practices for theme implementation

### Color Palette
- **Keep existing site colors** — do not redesign the color palette
- Dark theme background style at Claude's discretion
- Wave animation color behavior between themes at Claude's discretion

### Typography Scale
- Font choices, scaling approach (fluid vs breakpoints), base size, and heading prominence all at Claude's discretion
- Should ensure WCAG compliance and good readability

### Visual Polish
- Loading state style, hover/focus interaction timing, and shadow usage all at Claude's discretion

### Claude's Discretion
- Theme system implementation details (initial state, storage, placement, transitions)
- Dark theme background color choice
- Wave color adaptation between themes
- Typography: font family, scaling method, base size, heading style
- Loading states, interaction timing, shadow usage
- All implementation should align with "modern tech portfolio" aesthetic
