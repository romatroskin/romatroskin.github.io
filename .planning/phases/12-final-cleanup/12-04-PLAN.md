<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run Full Verification Suite</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Execute complete verification of Phase 12 work:

1. **Lint Check:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   Expected: 0 errors, 0 warnings

2. **Test Suite:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   Expected: All 116+ tests pass

3. **Production Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Expected: Build completes with no errors or warnings

4. **Preview Production Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   Expected: Site loads correctly at localhost:4173

Verify Phase 12 success criteria:
- [ ] Contact section submit button is visually centered or appropriately sized
- [ ] No unused source files, dead code, or orphaned imports
- [ ] Home section extracted from App.tsx into HeroSection component
- [ ] All lint errors resolved (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [ ] Build passes without warnings, tests pass
  </action>
  <verify>All commands exit with code 0</verify>
  <done>Full verification suite passes</done>

  <what-built>
Phase 12 cleanup work:
- ESLint configuration updated (console.warn/error allowed, underscore pattern)
- All 17 lint errors and 2 warnings fixed
- HeroSection extracted from App.tsx
- Contact button styling fixed (centered)
- coverage/ added to .gitignore
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173
2. Check Hero section renders correctly (logo, tagline, scroll button)
3. Click "Discover More" - should scroll to Services
4. Scroll to Contact section - verify submit button is appropriately sized/centered
5. Check both light and dark themes
6. Run `npm run lint` - should show 0 problems
7. Run `npm test` - should show 116+ tests passing
  </how-to-verify>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Deploy the cleaned up codebase to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This runs `npm run build && gh-pages -d dist` which:
1. Creates production build in dist/
2. Pushes dist/ to gh-pages branch
3. GitHub Pages serves from gh-pages branch

Verify deployment by visiting the live site URL.
  </action>
  <verify>Site accessible at https://romatroskin.github.io (or configured domain)</verify>
  <done>Site deployed successfully to GitHub Pages</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run lint` shows 0 problems
2. `npm test` passes all tests
3. `npm run build` completes successfully
4. `npm run deploy` completes successfully
5. Live site loads correctly with all sections
</verification>

<success_criteria>
All Phase 12 success criteria confirmed:
1. Contact section submit button is visually centered or appropriately sized
2. No unused source files, dead code, or orphaned imports in the codebase
3. Home section extracted from App.tsx into dedicated component
4. All lint errors resolved (0 errors, 0 warnings)
5. Build passes without warnings, tests pass, site deploys successfully
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/12-final-cleanup/12-04-SUMMARY.md`
