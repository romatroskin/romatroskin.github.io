<objective>
Fix contact button styling and clean up generated files by adding coverage/ to .gitignore.

Purpose: Polish contact section UI and establish clean generated file management (Phase 12 success criteria #1, #2)
Output: Centered contact button, coverage/ gitignored

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Center Contact Submit Button</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/ContactSection/ContactSection.tsx</files>
  <action>
Fix the contact form submit button styling:

1. Remove the inline style that left-aligns the button:

   Change line 199 from:
   ```tsx
   style={{ alignSelf: 'flex-start' }}
   ```

   To: Remove the entire style prop, keeping just:
   ```tsx
   <button
     type="submit"
     disabled={state.submitting}
     aria-busy={state.submitting}
     className="cta-primary"
   >
   ```

2. The .cta-primary CSS class already provides proper styling including:
   - min-height: 44px (touch target)
   - min-width: 44px (touch target)
   - padding for clickable area
   - hover/focus states

By removing alignSelf: flex-start, the button will inherit the parent form's alignment which uses flex-direction: column with natural centering or width: 100% which makes it full-width on mobile.

Alternative: If the button should be explicitly centered, add to App.css:
```css
.contact-form button[type="submit"] {
  align-self: center;
}
```

Decision: First try removing the inline style. If visual inspection shows it needs centering, the form's flex container should handle it. The form uses flex-direction: column so children stack vertically.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run dev and visually inspect contact section button alignment</verify>
  <done>Contact button no longer forced to left alignment</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add coverage/ to .gitignore and Clean Git History</name>
  <files>.gitignore</files>
  <action>
Update .gitignore to exclude generated coverage files:

1. Add coverage entries to .gitignore at end of file:
```
# Test coverage
coverage/
*.coverage
.nyc_output/
```

2. Remove coverage/ from git tracking (if currently tracked):
```bash
git rm -r --cached coverage/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

3. The coverage/ files shown in git status will be untracked after this change.

Note: The eslint.config.js already has `{ ignores: ['dist', 'coverage', 'vite.config.ts'] }` but .gitignore was missing coverage/. This ensures generated test reports don't pollute commits.
  </action>
  <verify>git status should not show coverage/ files as modified after adding to gitignore</verify>
  <done>coverage/ folder is properly gitignored</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run dev` - contact button appears centered or full-width (not awkwardly left-aligned)
2. `git status` does not show coverage/ files
3. `npm run build` passes
4. `npm test` passes (116+ tests)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Contact submit button is visually appropriate (centered or full-width, not left-aligned)
- Button maintains 44px minimum touch target
- .gitignore includes coverage/ entry
- coverage/ folder not tracked by git
- Build and tests pass
</success_criteria>
