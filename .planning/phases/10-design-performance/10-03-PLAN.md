<objective>
Verify Lighthouse scores and Core Web Vitals meet v1.1 targets through production audit.

Purpose: Confirm all performance requirements (PERF-01 through PERF-07) are met before completing the phase.

Output: Verified Lighthouse scores (90+/100/100/100) and Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run Lighthouse audit on production build</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
1. Build the production bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the preview server:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. Open Chrome DevTools and run Lighthouse audit:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:4173 (default Vite preview port)
   - Open DevTools > Lighthouse tab
   - Select: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO
   - Device: Mobile (more demanding test)
   - Run audit

4. Record the scores:
   - Performance: Target 90+
   - Accessibility: Target 100
   - Best Practices: Target 100
   - SEO: Target 100

5. Record Core Web Vitals from the Performance section:
   - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): Target < 2.5s
   - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): Target < 0.1
   - TBT (Total Blocking Time): Note the value

If any score is below target:
- Performance < 90: Check for render-blocking resources, unoptimized images, or heavy JavaScript
- Accessibility < 100: Check for missing labels, contrast issues, or focus indicators
- Best Practices < 100: Check for console errors, HTTPS issues, or deprecated APIs
- SEO < 100: Check for missing meta tags or robots issues

Note the actual scores and any issues found in the verification output.
  </action>
  <verify>
Lighthouse audit completed with scores recorded. Note exact scores in the summary.

  <name>Task 2: Test keyboard navigation and focus indicators</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
1. With the preview server still running, open the site in a fresh browser tab.

2. Test keyboard navigation:
   - Press Tab repeatedly to move through all interactive elements
   - Verify focus ring is visible on each element
   - Check: Header nav links, scroll indicator button, CTA button, contact form inputs, social links

3. Verify focus indicator contrast:
   - In light theme: Focus ring should be visible against light backgrounds
   - In dark theme: Focus ring should be visible against dark backgrounds
   - Toggle theme using the theme button and re-test

4. Test contact form accessibility:
   - Tab to each input field - focus ring appears
   - Enter invalid email - error message announced (aria-describedby)
   - Submit empty form - error states visible

5. Record any issues found with focus visibility or keyboard navigation.
  </action>
  <verify>
All interactive elements are keyboard accessible with visible focus indicators in both themes.
  </verify>
  <done>Keyboard navigation works across all interactive elements, focus indicators visible in both themes</done>

  <what-built>
Typography system with fluid scaling, enhanced focus indicators, and image optimization have been implemented. Lighthouse scores and Core Web Vitals have been measured.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Visit the preview URL (http://localhost:4173) if still running, or run `npm run preview`

2. Visual verification:
   - Resize browser from 320px to 1440px width - typography should scale smoothly
   - Toggle dark/light theme - colors and focus indicators should adapt
   - Tab through all interactive elements - focus rings should be visible

3. Check the Lighthouse scores from Task 1:
   - Performance: Should be 90+ (if not, note the score)
   - Accessibility: Should be 100
   - Best Practices: Should be 100
   - SEO: Should be 100

4. Confirm Core Web Vitals:
   - LCP < 2.5s
   - CLS < 0.1

5. If any scores are below target, describe the specific issues.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if all requirements met.
If scores are below target, describe the issues and whether they're acceptable blockers or should be addressed.
