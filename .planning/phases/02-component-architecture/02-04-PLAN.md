<objective>
Visual verification checkpoint after gap closure fixes.

Purpose: Human verification that scroll responsiveness and wave rendering issues are resolved.
Output: Confirmation of visual parity and correct scroll behavior.

  <what-built>
Fixed scroll responsiveness and wave cutoff issues:
1. App.tsx scroll binding corrected to capture parallax container after mount
2. Wave.tsx uses ResizeObserver for accurate container measurement
3. Path calculation extended to prevent edge cutoff
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**1. Start the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**2. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser**

**3. Test scroll responsiveness (CRITICAL):**
- Scroll down the page slowly
- **Expected:** Wave height should increase as you scroll down
- **Expected:** Wave amplitude should change during scroll
- **Expected:** Animation continues smoothly, no stuttering

**4. Test viewport widths (check for cutoff):**
- Open DevTools (F12) and toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
- Test these widths:
  - 320px (mobile)
  - 768px (tablet)
  - 1024px (small desktop)
  - 1440px (standard desktop)
  - 1920px (large desktop)
- **Expected:** Wave fills entire width with NO visible right-edge cutoff
- **Expected:** Wave animation smooth at all sizes

**5. Check console for errors:**
- Open browser DevTools Console tab
- Scroll and resize
- **Expected:** No errors or warnings related to Wave/animation

**6. Compare with original behavior (if possible):**
- If you have screenshots or memory of the original class component behavior
- Verify the functional component now matches

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Scroll changes wave height/amplitude in real-time
- [ ] Wave extends to full width at 320px
- [ ] Wave extends to full width at 768px
- [ ] Wave extends to full width at 1024px
- [ ] Wave extends to full width at 1440px
- [ ] Wave extends to full width at 1920px
- [ ] No console errors during scroll/resize
- [ ] Animation is smooth (no stuttering or frame drops)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe specific issues with viewport sizes or scroll behavior that still need fixing</resume-signal>

<success_criteria>
- Human confirms scroll responsiveness is working (wave responds to scroll position)
- Human confirms wave renders at full width at all tested viewport sizes
- Human confirms no visible cutoff on right edge
- Human confirms animation is smooth during interactions
</success_criteria>
