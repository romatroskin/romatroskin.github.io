# Phase 11: Documentation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

README.md that provides project overview, build instructions, technology context, and licensing for the Puff Puff Dev portfolio site. Clear enough for a new developer to clone and run locally in under 5 minutes.

## Implementation Decisions

### README Structure
- Portfolio-focused sections: Overview, Features, Tech stack, Quick start, Build commands, License
- Live demo link in hero position — large, prominent, right after title
- Scannable length (~200-300 lines) — quick to read, details in code
- Features section balances technical achievements (Perlin noise, react-spring) and UX highlights (dark mode, responsive)

### Visual Elements
- Badges at top: Core stack (React, TypeScript, Vite), Quality indicators (test coverage, Lighthouse, build status), Deployment (GitHub Pages, license)
- All badges link to their respective tools/reports
- Preview image/GIF: Claude's discretion on what works best

### Content Depth
- Animation system: Brief mention only ("Uses Perlin noise for organic wave animations")
- Tech rationale: Claude's discretion on what needs explanation
- Build instructions: Copy-paste ready (clone, npm install, npm run dev)
- No Contributing section — personal portfolio, not expecting contributions

### Target Audience
- Both developers and recruiters equally
- Context: Implicit — let the content speak for itself
- Author contact: Link to site's contact section
- Tone: Professional — clean, direct, no fluff

### Claude's Discretion
- Screenshot vs animated GIF for preview
- Badge style (shields.io flat, flat-square, or for-the-badge)
- Whether specific tech choices need brief rationale
- Exact section ordering within the structure
