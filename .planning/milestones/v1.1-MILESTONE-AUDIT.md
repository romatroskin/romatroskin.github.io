## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: First Visit Flow ✓ COMPLETE

1. User lands on Hero → HeroSection rendered at page 0
2. Sees logo/tagline → Logo and "Where Code Meets Creativity, Dreams Take Shape" display
3. Clicks "Discover More" → Scrolls to Services (page 1)
4. Navigates via header → Home/Services/About/Contact all work

### Flow 2: Contact Flow ✓ COMPLETE

1. User clicks Contact in nav → Scrolls to page 3
2. Fills form → Name, email, message fields with validation
3. Submits → Formspree API called with ID 'xwvqgrdl'
4. Success message → "Thank you for reaching out!" displayed

### Flow 3: Theme Toggle Flow ✓ COMPLETE

1. User toggles theme → ThemeToggle calls useTheme hook
2. Theme changes → data-theme attribute updates on documentElement
3. All sections update → Hero, Services, About, Contact all react to theme
4. Wave colors adapt → Computed colors update in App.tsx

### Flow 4: Mobile Navigation Flow ✓ COMPLETE

2. Sees nav items → Home, Services, About, Contact visible
3. Clicks Contact → Menu closes, scrolls to Contact section
4. Focus management → Focus trap and body scroll lock work correctly

**All 4 flows complete. No broken steps.**

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 7: SEO Foundation

Human verification items (code is complete, external validation needed):

- Social media previews (Facebook/Twitter) require testing with deployed URL
- Organization schema validation with schema.org or Google Rich Results Test
- Brotli compression serving confirmation via browser DevTools
- iOS/Android home screen icon testing on physical devices

**Impact:** Low — these are validation steps, not code issues.

### Phase 8: Architecture Optimization

- **esbuild vulnerabilities (2 moderate):** Dev-only, requires Vite 7 upgrade. Deferred to v1.2 milestone.
- **Major version updates (12 packages):** React 19, Vite 7, @react-spring v10, etc. Deliberately deferred to v1.2 to avoid breaking changes during polish phase.

**Impact:** Low — dev-only vulnerabilities, updates are optional improvements.

### Phase 10: Design & Performance

- **Lighthouse Best Practices:** 96/100 (not 100) due to third-party assets from react-social-icons loading via CDN.

**Impact:** None — 96 is excellent, 4 points from third-party library is acceptable.

## Conclusion

**v1.1 Milestone: PASSED**

- 37/37 requirements satisfied
- 6/6 phases complete
- 18/18 integration points wired
- 4/4 E2E flows functional
- 0 critical gaps
- 0 blockers

The site is production-ready. Tech debt items are minor (human verification steps, optional upgrades, third-party library quirk) and do not block release.

**Ready for `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.1`**
