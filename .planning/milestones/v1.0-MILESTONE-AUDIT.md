### Cross-Phase Wiring ✅

All phases properly integrated with verified connections:

| From | To | Connection | Status |
|------|----|-----------:|--------|
| Phase 2 | Phase 5 | usePerlinNoise → cachedPerlin2 memoization | ✅ Wired |
| Phase 4 | Phase 6 | useTheme → storage.ts fallback | ✅ Wired |
| Phase 3 | Phase 4 | ThemeToggle → ARIA labels | ✅ Wired |
| Phase 5 | Phase 2 | useAdaptiveFrameRate → fps → useAnimationFrame | ✅ Wired |

### E2E User Flows ✅

| 6 | Error recovery with graceful fallback | ✅ Complete |

### Orphaned Code

| File | Export | Reason | Severity |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| useScrollSpy.ts | useScrollSpy | Alternative implementation chosen for Parallax compatibility | Low |

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation & Cleanup

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| vite.config.ts uses 'as any' | ⚠️ Warning | Lint warning, no runtime impact |
| eslint.config.js missing 'coverage' ignore | ⚠️ Warning | False lint warnings in coverage files |

### Phase 3: Navigation & Core A11Y

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| useScrollSpy hook unused | ℹ️ Info | Created but Parallax required manual scroll tracking |

**Total Tech Debt Items:** 3 (all non-critical)

## Human Verification Summary

Some features require human testing due to browser-specific behavior, animation perception, or external tool requirements (Lighthouse).

### Phase 3: 7 Tests Required
- Skip link keyboard navigation
- Navigation smooth scroll
- Active section highlighting
- Mobile menu interaction
- Focus trap in mobile menu
- Focus indicators visibility
- Screen reader landmarks

### Phase 4: 8 Tests Required
- Theme toggle and persistence
- System preference fallback
- FOUC prevention
- Responsive design (320px minimum)
- Browser zoom (200%)
- Reduced motion accessibility
- Print stylesheet
- Contrast ratio (WCAG compliance via Lighthouse)

### Phase 5: 4 Tests Required
- Lighthouse performance audit (target: 90+ mobile)
- Reduced motion behavior
- Adaptive quality on low-end devices
- Lazy loading UX

### Phase 6: 3 Tests Required
- Error boundary visual test
- App fallback retry test
- Private browsing mode test

**Total Human Tests:** 22 across 4 phases

## Test Coverage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Test Files | 12 |
| Total Tests | 99 |
| All Tests Passing | ✅ Yes |
| Accessibility Tests | 4 components with vitest-axe |

## Build Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `npm run build` | ✅ Success (857ms) |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | ✅ No errors |
| `npm test` | ✅ 99 tests passing |
| Bundle Size | ~210 KB (JS) + ~19 KB (CSS) |

## Architecture Highlights

### Performance Infrastructure
- Web Vitals monitoring (LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, TTFB)
- Long Animation Frames monitoring
- Adaptive frame rate (15/24/30 fps based on device)
- Perlin noise memoization (1000-entry cache)
- React.lazy for below-fold sections

### Accessibility Features
- Skip-to-content link
- Focus trap in mobile menu
- ARIA labels and landmarks
- Reduced motion support
- 44px touch targets
- WCAG AA contrast ratios

### Error Resilience
- ErrorBoundary at app and wave levels
- localStorage fallback to memory storage
- Silent wave fallback (gradient background)
- Retry UI for app-level errors

### Theme System
- FOUC prevention via inline script
- localStorage persistence
- System preference detection
- CSS custom properties for themes
- Smooth transitions between modes

## Recommendations

### For Production Release

1. **Run human verification tests** - 22 manual tests across 4 phases to confirm browser behavior
2. **Run Lighthouse audit** - Verify 90+ performance score on mobile
3. **Test on real mobile devices** - Confirm animation smoothness and touch interactions

### For Future Milestones

1. **Address tech debt** - Fix vite.config.ts type assertion, add coverage to eslint ignores
2. **Consider scroll progress indicator** (REQ-NAV-004) - Deferred from v1
3. **Complete CSS Modules migration** (REQ-CQ-008) - Migrate remaining global CSS
4. **Document useScrollSpy alternative** - Add JSDoc noting Parallax incompatibility

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1 is APPROVED for completion.**

All critical requirements satisfied, strong integration health, complete E2E flows, and comprehensive test coverage. Tech debt is minimal and non-blocking. Human verification tests should be run before production deployment but do not block milestone completion.
